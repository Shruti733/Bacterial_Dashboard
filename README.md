# Bacterial_Dashboard

## Purpose
We are working with Bacterial data using Javascript and Plotly module. Plotly module is required to plot visualizations
for the bacterial data for each volunteer. We were required to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. This way it might be possible to identify a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef which will in turn be useful to
identify whether that species is found in navel.

It is required to present all the analysis in the form of a dashboard hosted on git pages so that it can be shared with anyone who has access to internet.
